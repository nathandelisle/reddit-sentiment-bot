So yeah very new.\n\nBelieve it or not, she dumped a lot more on me than I did to her in our initial conversations (in-person and the first couple weeks of texting). And she was the one who initiated and made me feel comfortable opening up. I made sure not to overshare, until the ending obviously.\n\nI think what you said about it being difficult to be honest without hurting someone is what she was struggling with. I told her that she could tell me anything, including if she wanted me to stop texting for X amount of time, but I understand that it can be difficult to actually tell someone that. I agree that it's best to stop thinking about it. I have to accept that I'll likely never get the answers and closure I'm looking for. Thanks for your thoughtful response.",

It's not clear from your post how long this friendship lasted, but especially if it was relatively new, you have to be careful with how much you're venting to or deeply sharing with a friend. I have been the recipient in this kind of situation, and it is uncomfortable and stifling to feel like I am constantly being put in the position of being someone's pseudo-therapist. Your friend certainly should have communicated that she felt you were putting too much on her, but speaking from experience, it can be harder than it sounds to be honest when you feel like you'd be causing even more hurt to someone who is already in a vulnerable position (even though you ended up hurt regardless).\n\nI think it's great that you're looking into finding therapy and trying to find other, healthier avenues for getting your thoughts out. You can't undo what happened here, and you're likely going to have to let go of any idea of a future friendship with this specific person, but it sounds like you're on a good track to develop healthier relationships down the line!",

She's not in charge. She's not the gatekeeper. So the conversation you're going to have... I would draw attention to just being confident in who you've worked so hard to become, and go into the conversation as if it wouldn't matter to you if she said \"no\". If this outlook isn't the case (e.g. you're really not looking for her approval, it's just the phrasing), my suggestion would still be the same.\n\nThen again, there's a rule in this subreddit against reaching out to the former friend...

I'm pretty sure you would have told her where she's able to sleep, considering how, from the sounds of things, you don't seem to have a spare room, just a spare couch?

        "body": "There's a handful of people in here who fell into that grey area of female friendship. Thinking back, I think I was infatuated, not really in love. I was, how you say, \"professional\" when it came to my feelings. I always acted in the spirit of friendship and never did anything to proactively and openly flirt or try to win brownie points in the hopes of bringing our friendship closer to romance. I'm grimly satisfied I had done that. On my former best friend's side, however, she just kept pushing the boundaries, and her efforts seemed to only get more intense once her then boyfriend dumped her. It even came to a point where she saw nothing wrong with us sharing the same bed in a hotel room, even though I was like, I can't do that; if I'm going on this trip with you, we need separate beds. So when I disclosed my crush, the mild disgust in her voice as she told me she had never thought of us that way made me laugh without humour. She either had repressed feelings for me, or she never actually considered the consequences of her own actions and was happy enough to milk my \"affections\" for all they were worth, which she could not honestly bring herself to acknowledge. \n\nDon't get me wrong; my former best friend did make me feel special and appreciated as well, but I get the impression that perhaps yourself and your former friend had a healthier approach somehow... To me, at least, it comes across as if the two of you could tell each other about some concern in the friendship, and you both afforded each other the space to do that (or am I misinterpreting?) Towards the end, however, I will admit to having treated my former friendship more like a possessive habit. I haven't fully understood yet the root cause of this change. Something changed at that time for my former friend as well, and we just started to feed into it.\n\nGirls who become bitchy in groups at uni... ah yes, age-old tradition! This happened to an old friend of mine. I'm sorry it also happened to you. I would second looking askance at a \"controlling personality type\", though I'm not sure you can entirely stay away from them. Even people who don't tend to be controlling by nature can become that way when they get jealous. But it's good to recognise those types of behaviours and ensure you have your boundaries in place. What you learnt from the friendship demise is very valuable, particularly the codependency. That's how friendship with my former best friend happened to be, until I went to therapy this year and managed to break the pattern. It seems really dumb now, but _boundaries_ would have solved so many problems, right! Codependent friendships are complicated. It's hard to see how unhealthy something has become once ingrained in the friendship. I remember the eerie moment where my former friend said \"we\" instead of \"I\", before quickly correcting herself. That's how enmeshed we had become. When I was trying to converse with her like an equal, I got the uncomfortable sense that she didn't even know how to do that. And to this day, I wonder to what extent had I crippled her and to what extent had she crippled herself?\n\nYou're like a breath of fresh air to me! And as you can see, I could go on for ages as well, haha! Sure, let's chat some more about this. Get it all out of our system!",
