And the dream presents this idyllic grand reconciliation and everything getting back to normal and my life being all sunshine and rainbows\u2026 and then I wake up. \n \nMy brain needs to cut the crap honestly. It\u2019s so annoying when I have a good day and go to sleep and bam there they are again. But it is a way of your brain processing the emotions. \n\nRemember. Grief is the price we pay for love. \n\nHonestly these dreams are just evidence that you have capacity for love and deep emotional connection and that\u2019s a great thing. You should look forward to experiencing this depth of feeling again with a friend you are more compatible with. You may even re-experience this with the same friend, who knows. But it would likely have to be redeveloped. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been or what happened with you, but reconciliation will take time and huge emotional effort from both sides. You have to be stable enough to cope with it in order to restore the friendship. You know your friend very well. How will they react? Will they hold a grudge, or do you think they can see past what happened? These are all things you need to consider. \n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of reaching out, give it time. Really think it through. Write out a message and leave it for days or even weeks. Think about it not only when you are feeling lonely and miserable, and not only when you have just woken up from one of these dreams, but also when you are calm. In a fleeting moment of peace in your current day to day life, take a second to again think about reaching out, how you think they would respond, do you have the emotional capacity to cope with the reconciliation right now, or are you likely to make more mistakes that would worsen the situation and disrupt your healing process. Write down how you feel in this moment. Because that is not worth it. No matter how much time you take to heal from this, if your friendship is true, your friendship will reform. Allow yourself to get to this point. Where their response makes no difference to your progress or your life. Let yourself get to the point where, if they offer rejection, you can simply take that as closure with no hard feelings. I\u2019m waiting for this moment and plan to reach out as soon as it comes. But I know as long as I\u2019m dreaming about them, still struggling to accept the breakup, and feeling very emotionally unstable, I am not ready.\n\nI have such vivid dreams it can be really hard to snap out of it in the morning and not let it affect your day. They can feel so real it is honestly horrible. I always give myself a few minutes in the morning to meditate and talk myself through the dream. I can remind myself that it is part of the journey and that they do not represent the reality of the situation I am in. \n\nThink of it like, your brain is working overtime in your sleep processing the emotions so you can move on faster. It\u2019s a lot better to have the memories flooding through in your subconscious state than actively disrupting your day to day life. You really could make an inside out movie on this haha. Sending lots of good luck for the future and hope you begin to have lots of lovely dreams about all the good parts of life soon :))",

Without a specific timeline of events leading up to this particular disappearance of your friend, the only deductions I can really make are that you may indeed have done something as it isn't normal for family members of a friend to socially ignore you. So if you would like some specific advice, I think you may need to share some more information on specific moments. Maybe then The Reason This Has Happened could be clearer.\n\nIn the meantime, I would suggest a way to process this would be: \n\n(1) Ask yourself what a true friend would have done in this situation, if they had really wanted you to know why they could no longer be your friend. Also, what is it you would have done yourself, if you had been in your friend's position? This way, you can slowly realise that it isn't all your fault and you're not the only one with faults.\n\n(2) Ask yourself what are you going to do to grow from this moment? You're allowed to feel confused and sad, but you cannot hope to move forward, giving too much control to your friend. You already know that your friend does not seem to be interested at the moment in your friendship. So you must do what we all try to do, those of us who have lost important friends: Try to regain the confidence we lost in ourselves. You still have a lot to offer other friends and potential new friendships. Learn what you can to become stronger and more confident. It is possible to not need someone who didn't even say \"goodbye\".",

        "body": "I know what you mean. My situation is similar but also different. 28m here. I befriended a woman about four years ago. We would talk all the time, then became absolute best friends. She was constantly coming to me with a new issue almost daily. I would always stop whatever it is I was doing and be there for her no matter what. Then when I needed someone to talk to, she would sometimes be there for me but most of the time she wouldn't be. I lost someone very dear to me and I was texting her how upset I was about it, then she messages me the next day and says \"hey im so sorry can you check my facebook and see if i've been hacked?\" I knew right then that she more than likely didn't care about me even though she has told me multiple times I was her best friend and she cared \"so deeply\" for me. The whole thing felt very one sided but I overlooked it because i really cared about her. We got along great, had the same sense of humor, same interests, same taste in music etc. She would always do things that were morally abhorrent as well but silly me didn't care! We had a falling out a couple of months ago. I developed feelings for her and I was honest with her about it and put myself in a vulnerable position and made it clear I did not expect the same feeling in return I just felt like I needed to get it off my chest. So she said \"I'll respond back to this asap!\" Then nothing. A week later I reached out then she responded \"you completely overwhelmed me and i didnt know what to say or do\" then going off about a ton of things that had nothing to do with me at all. I understand if it was a lot..but I didn't understand why she couldn't have just told me that from the start. I thought we had each others full trust and could be open with each other! So I finally asked if she didn't want to talk to me anymore, if so It's fine I just wanted to know so I won't be a bother! Then she blew up on me about all the problems in her personal life again.  About a month later she reaches out to me, and after making small talk I apologized, and let her know I just wanted to go back to how things were. Now that time has passed I realize I should never have to apologize for telling someone how I feel. I was just so terrified of losing as her completely that I thought it would be best. She messages back and says \"I need you in my life and I need you to know that I'll respond back asap I promise it won't be like last time I swear on my dad I will I love you.\" Then, nothing!! So I had enough and asked her \"Why do you do this?\" then her response was \"Clearly this is very hard for me to broach and I feel like clearly you want something out of this otherwise you wouldn't keep bringing it up\" when all I was trying to do was mend the friendship. Well, she blocked me immediately on every social media platform, and blocked my number. It has absolutely destroyed me and I have never felt so heartbroken in my life. It's made me question my sanity, it's made my self esteem completely go away, I have no confidence anymore and I never want to be vulnerable with anyone else.  I find myself questioning our dynamic as well. It seems like I was just her safe space. Someone she knew would always be there and never judge her no matter what. I was more than likely used for constant emotional support and validation which she seems to feed off of. Heck, she's even shown me screenshots from other guys calling her out for the same behavior and I completely ignored that red flag because \"oh there's no way she would do that to me!\" I'll cherish the memories we made together, but that's all she is now. Just a memory. I can't stop thinking about it. I have never felt more hurt in all of my life. I just have to remind myself that I don't deserve to be treated like a doormat by anyone, nobody does. I hope we both start feeling better soon! It's very hard.",

        "body": "This is so interesting. I had a similar dynamic with my ex best friend, but the opposite. She always looked after me and was basically a second mum. I had never had a friendship like this before but I was perfect for the dynamic. I have adhd and anxiety and am so chaotic and clumsy. She enjoyed taking on a mother figure and it worked perfectly. We shared everything with each other and for the most part supported each other in everything. I completely idolised her, thought she was the strongest person ever and loved her so much, and she did me. While she did a lot for me, I also was always there for her whenever she needed it and did a lot for her.We were very happy as best friends and became like sisters. \n\nHowever we became part of a group and the close knit bond we had formed dissipated within the group. I really struggled with this because I missed when it was just us two and (selfishly) wanted her to myself. However we all got very close and it was perfect. However I went through a difficult time getting in and out of relationships, health issues, in and out of bad jobs. I was basically just a mess. I for  sure relied on her way too mcuh and started to feel it. I always had an issue and the people I lived with suffered to. I lived with her so it was difficult to manage for both of us. I isolated myself when I had a lot of work to do after thee years of friendship and instead dumped everything on my new boyfriend at the time. I became selfish with my time and utterly hyper focused on my work. I could feel growing resentment from her and I felt like she was talking about me with the other people in the group. These people were basically my family at this point so I was heartbroken when I found out they were talking. \n\n But I think my actions didn\u2019t reflect how I truly felt about them. Because I loved them so much, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to be upbeat and happy with them so isolated myself and thought they would have more fun without me. Anyway the friendship ended because I confronted her about talking behind my back and how it was making me uncomfortable. This was not taken well and they basically cut me off and we both said horrible things to each other. I moved out of the house and only spoke/argued with them over bills and stuff like that. It\u2019s been 3 months now since we spoke. \n\nIt\u2019s only now I realise how unhealthy the friendship was for everyone involved. I was in a terrible place and unable to make decisions or anything independently because I had grown to be codependent on my friend. I had never been like this with anyone else so I think it just grew from our dynamic and living together for so long, combined with my poor mental health with added life stressors. I think our friendship needed a huge reset and I need to heal myself before I ever thought of reconnecting. But we said bad things so im processing it as if she\u2019s completely done with me. I regret how I acted and it\u2019s something I need to work on. I also think I need to work on boundaries because having a friendship that close is not always a good thing when you go through  an extended period of poor mental health and can result in emotional damage. I feel terrible for everything I put my close friends through and wish I made more effort to make them feel valued and appreciated.  I\u2019m glad I can grow and change and I for sure learnt the lesson to never be that person again. Sorry you had to go through this",

        "body": "I wouldn\u2019t recommend deleting any past photos. You never know what could happen and this person might well come back into your life down the line. You had happy memories with her and don\u2019t forget that just because you are heartbroken because you may regret having a whole section of your life missing. When you\u2019re old you may want to look back at your memories and the special impacts this person had on your life. You may even reconnect and look fondly at old memories together. I think you should give her time, grief does weird things to people and she may have been having a rough time for a while and isolated herself. Let her know you\u2019re always there and leave it at that. Losing a family member can do weird things to people and her grandma may have been ill for a while. However, you should also put yourself first and accept you need to process your own grief and fully accept that your friendship may be over. If you do not do this, you may be setting yourself up for pain if she truly does not return to the friendship. If she does return, if you have processed the ending of the friendship, you can decide whether to proceed and it will harbour a healthy relationship as you get to know one another again in a different context and you are not holding on to resentment due to her abandonment. It\u2019s a win-win to begin to process the grief and come to peace with it. But it\u2019s not an easy process.\n\nDefinitely limit yourself from looking at the photos or store them in an album somewhere. I deleted all my social media because it was more painful for me to see what she was up to currently. This was the best decision I made and I really don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever redownload them. Your brain needs to register that you had this person in your life and now they are not around. In your life, they no longer exist. I found this to be the most effective way to speed up the process of processing the emotions mentally. You can keep old memories of them but you have to make an attempt to disconnect them from your life right now. I know exactly the sinking feeling of looking back at old memories and going \u201chold on, things weren\u2019t meant to go this way\u201d. Also remember that everything captured online, in a birthday post, or even old photos, will likely only present the amazing parts of the relationship you had so your brain can be confused and over romanticise the relationship leading to more pain. You need to give your brain time. Disconnect from the person first, allow yourself to really grieve. Cry and treat it as if you lost someone because you did. Allow yourself to feel sad and talk about it with others. I found it helpful to run through the stages of grief in my mind and place myself along the scale. I was in denial for a long time and I couldn\u2019t feel sad because I just couldn\u2019t accept it had happened. Now I am in the depression stage. It sucks but honestly it\u2019s really helpful because I feel like I have progressed and moving ever closer to that golden acceptance stage. (I know grieving is not linear, but imagining it like this helps me to extract something good from how I am currently feeling and be optimistic about the future). I hope this advice helps you, I am not a professional by any means but I have done a lot of research and these are just the things that have helped me. I love this subreddit because we can all relate and I never thought a friendship breakup would be this hard but it really is. All the emotions. Let me know how it\u2019s going! <3",

I replied to that saying i understand and no pressure etc. but if by some miracle whether now or in 5 years time she felt like reaching out I would always be here. \n\nI understand, I think if I apologized years ago it would have gone like you. I took years to reach out because I had to grow enough and change enough to truly understand what I did and to be confident IF she accepted me back into her life there was no chance of something like that happening again, for her sake. I also didn\u2019t really try to explain much nor try to win her back, mostly just talked about what I realize I did wrong and saying sorry for all those things. \n\nMaybe you can wait a while, a year or two and then try again? Things might be too fresh and not enough time has passed for her to believe you have changed. I wish you luck and hope it works out for you either way and sorry this has happened",

If we didn't experience grief, we'd never move on. \n\nFor lost friends who are still living, it's a little jarring to realize you still have complicated feelings for them when you see them around. But ultimately, you also made room for new friendships in your heart, and that's the biggest positive that comes out of this process of loss and recovery.",

There are friends who know their limits socially and will already wish you a proper farewell, with or without the promise to catch up again, should you find yourself back in the country or closer to home. A rare few will make the effort to stay in touch and want to know more about your new life, either keeping up the connection out of genuine love and interest or until they feel you have settled in and possibly don't need them anymore.\n\nAs you can tell, it is quite the lucky immigrant, emigrant or expat (whichever you prefer), who still manages to remain good friends with those they leave behind \"back home\". If you feel like you have one or two friends \"back home\" who are still strong connections, message them and express how you would like their support during this difficult time trying to settle in to a new place. If they can support you, great! If not, I would suggest going to a local meet-up event for people in a similar position or even chatting in subreddits to find those who have experienced what you're going through already after they \"left home\".\n\nI'm a bit long in the tooth now, and only really keep in touch with 1-2 people from abroad - usually when I'm about to visit the country or when something important happens. In the meantime, I made my friends here and I have my hobbies. Once you have those sorts of things available to you locally, you'll find yourself unable to keep in touch with the friends \"back home\". The circle of life!",

        "body": "Hey! I came to ur page looking for your story because of the comment u left on mine and wanted to give some advice. I was in the opposite shoe and wanted to give my perspective. It\u2019s slightly different because this guy was in a relationship at the time, we were close friends for about a year and got drunk and confessed to me that he\u2019d liked me the whole time in this kind of (what he thought) was a romantic gesture. This kind of shook me up, because I considered him a close friend, almost like an older brother. What he did kind of upset me because I felt like he betrayed his ex and also I felt a bit lied to. (Girls normally feel safer in friendships with guys in relationships for this very reason). \n\nI explained this to him and he basically replied saying he understands but if the feelings ever changed on my side he\u2019d still be there. This majorly put me off because I felt like he\u2019d just be waiting and I felt like I couldn\u2019t talk to him about other guys like I used to cos it just felt a bit awkward? Everyone knows you can\u2019t get over people that quickly, so to go straight from a confession like that to \u201cback to normal\u201d is strange for both sides. I left it a few months and then we met up. The vibes were just a bit odd and to be honest I just got the sense he hadn\u2019t got over it. He talked about other girls he\u2019d been seeing in a way that just felt like he was trying to prove something. \n\nSo I think what you really need to decide is could you really be friends with this person and watch them marry someone else, live a life with someone else? Or would that be painful for you? I didn\u2019t think my friend would like that he already expressed to me he felt jealous when I saw other guys. This made me feel uncomfortable because I wouldn\u2019t want to put him through that. In my case I felt the best thing to do was to just have space because I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling he wasn\u2019t over it. It would\u2019ve been unfair to continue on either side. He blocked me on everything in the end. However I don\u2019t think we were as close as you were, because I definitely am going through a worse friendship breakup right now. \n\nMy main words would be that you did the right thing confessing. If you hadn\u2019t you would\u2019ve caused yourself a lot more hurt down the line. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Give it time, for sure. And don\u2019t feel that your ex friend didn\u2019t care about you because that is very unlikely. If you have a true friendship time will give you both clarity and you will reconnect. He\u2019s got to process it too. You can\u2019t control your feelings you were honest and communicative with your friend. But you shouldn\u2019t have any regrets and you obviously have lots of love to give, just be glad your saving it for the right soul <3",

I\u2019m trying to imagine it like it\u2019s a romantic breakup (for some reason this makes it feel better/validates how I\u2019m feeling). People breakup/divorce all the time when they were once happiest with one another. But they move on in the end and find someone else and more suited to them and are happy again, or find happiness within themselves. This is what this feels like. I might reach out but honestly I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to receive a harsh reply. But the way I left it I was very defensive. \n\nWe lived together and I moved out without speaking because the situation was too complicated and we were both going through exams so didn\u2019t really have time to resolve it. Plus I went into a really weird headspace and didn\u2019t feel up to confrontation at all. But there\u2019s so much left unsaid and we both said horrible things that didn\u2019t reflect the true nature of our friendship. So it\u2019s weird to leave it like that? I was thinking of sending a letter but I don\u2019t have her new address lol. Maybe an email? It\u2019s more for my peace of mind that I won\u2019t be checking read receipts or be caught off guard by it if that makes sense. A letter would be ideal though because I would never know when she got it and  it\u2019s more personal. \n\nI would put everything into resolving it but she had more problems with me that I didn\u2019t know about. Plus we were in a close group and she\u2019s kept them, so I don\u2019t think she needs me anymore :(. But who knows. Also I wouldn\u2019t put it past me to just be romanticising the whole friendship because I always do that. I think I will have to be incredibly stable before i think about reaching out. Thanks for your advice :). Hope it gets better for u <3",

We had a couple of arguments but always bounced back, the last one was no exception. I realized he started to pull away and things felt off. I suspect it was to do with our last argument so I tried to talk to him about it. I asked questions because I wanted to understand what went wrong. He said nothing but continued to push me away. I was confused and perhaps I pushed for answers too hard to the point he was uncomfortable. Only 2 months ago he said the friendship had given him too much anxiety and he wanted to demote me to superficial friends. At the end I backed off completely, aware the friendship is gone and there was nothing I can do but to let him go. \n\nPeople change and often outgrow friendships. Cherish those that still want to be in your life and forget those who don\u2019t. It will get better in time!\n\nSending hugs your way xx",

While I may not understand the full nuance of your friendship with this young woman, what I think I understand from reading your story is that you're somehow struggling with the mentor and friend dynamic in friendships.\n\nI've had a couple of friendships where there has been an age gap: The one that ended recently and which I talk exclusively about in this subreddit (we are opposite ends of the same decade) and one where the friend was in their 50s when I was just in my 20s. Both were women. While the former tended to stray more towards \"mentor\" in the final months (truly revealing the extent of an unhealthy respect from my former best friend's side and the foolish extent of arrogance on mine), my other friendship was an appropriate bond between two people who had experience in different lifetimes and could supportively share these experiences when needed (it was indeed one of the finest friendships I have ever had to date).\n\nWith this, I'm saying it is possible for women to have friendships with varying age gaps. Where the problem lies for men is that Western society, for instance, tends to view the same friendships between men and women with any significant age gap as questionable or unhealthy. In some cases, that indeed may be the case, but in others, it is a dying art, exhibiting healthy respect for the person who is youngest in the friendship. I struggled with that myself in my former friendship (I'm only human).\n\nTo what extent should you have been there for your younger friend's problems, particularly the romantic break-up? Well, it's hard to say, when the nuance of your friendship cannot be described in so few words. All I can say to this is... you couldn't have been her only friend, and I think it might have balanced things out if you had redirected her to someone closer to her age, perhaps a friend who had already experienced a romantic break-up at that young age. Or even suggested seeking the support of a trusted family member. It wouldn't have been abandoning your friend, but rather, it would have empowered her to put her eggs in different baskets, so that you wouldn't end up as you are feeling now: regretful that a friendship had to be ended because of this uneasiness you're starting to feel.\n\nAs an Internet stranger just offering an answer to the questions you've posed, I really encourage you to work on rebuilding your hurt self-esteem and focus on empowering yourself. The friendship has been formally ended. Your part is done. Exit stage left. Your young friend, you have to remember, can take care of herself. If you truly respect her autonomy and capabilities as a person, you, as a friend, should leave her to process the change in the friendship. In the future, she may look back on this moment as a \"growing\" event. And while she may not tell you for some years, or if ever, it is an event that often respects your maturity as the older adult, who, at the moment, has the life experience - and hopefully, the maturity - to do what is responsible and appropriate for the situation.",

I lost ALL my friends during that time period. I apologized for how I acted and the damage I caused. No one owes me forgiveness, though. If I hurt someone I never ever expect forgiveness. I was actively rotting and losing my mind. It was the scariest thing I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life and everyone I thought would always be there for me had left. \n\nI\u2019m still upset about what happened, and I know there\u2019s nothing I can do to make it better, so I just had to move in and create a new life for myself. I\u2019m doing a lot better than I ever have been before. I\u2019m so healthy and I\u2019m with someone who is committed to love me through anything. He\u2019s aware of my history and I explained to him how he could support me when things get bad or in unmedicated. He is extremely considerate and honestly relieves a lot of my symptoms because of how much stability he brought into my life. I still don\u2019t have too many friends but I\u2019m starting to prefer that because people are flaky and mean. I am so much happier now that I have a family, and school, and partner who supports me.",
